# Se
**Se**(lenium) is a cousin of [HyperSelenium](https://github.com/hydrogen2oxygen/hyperselenium). Both aims to enable a developer to write fast browser automations
for tests or other purposes. In contrast to Hyperselenium **Se** uses only Java without a script language.

## Features
- Simple automation creation
- Reusable Snippets
- Groups
- Parallel running multiple selenium docker instances

## Planned features
- Generate HTML protocol for all tests
- Online Server Application that (re)runs tests delivered inside a jar file (by syncing a git repo with JGit)
